  <h1>Welcome to the morse trainer by PA5WPM</h1>

    <h2 id="about-background">Background</h2>
    <p>
      In the Netherlands you had to take the Morse code exam at 12 words per minute to be allowed to work on the HF bands.
      Later on the speed was reduced to 5 words per minute. The old timers spoke of it as a shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was part of the first group who were allowed to take the exam at 5 words per minute.
      To tease the old timers, I took the call sign PA5WPM.
    </p>
    <p>
      As life goes on as it goes, I haven't had time for the hobby for 20 years.
      Meanwhile my speed has dropped to 0 words per minute.
      Getting call sign PA0WPM would be more appropriate, but that one is already in use.

    <h2>So pick up morse code again</h2>
    <p>
      There is a lot on offer, but broadcasts are at times that are not convenient to me.
      Hams like PA0HST do a great job in teaching morse code on air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morse code tutorial programs are old and don't run on modern Windows or non Windows platforms.
      So there is a market for a morsetrainer that runs in a browser and thus runs on any platform.
      There are some feature-limited browsers (Opera e.g.) that don't support speech synthesis.
      Try Chrome, Firefox or Edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also the old programs have a user interface that shows that UI/UX design is a profession in itself.
      As a professional programmer I should be able to create something nicer and better.

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>
      I came into contact with Nathan, PD5SAM, a new ham on the band that wanted to learn morse code.
      As he is a blind person, it was an eye-opener for me to work on accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      By EU law websites should be accessible to everyone.
      But in practice most developers don't understand how accessibility should work.
      So kudos to Nathan for teaching me how accessibility works in practice.

    <h2>Future plans</h2>
    <p>
      Have a straight morse code keyer supported, so you can learn how to send morse code.
