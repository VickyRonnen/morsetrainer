# Morse trainer

This project is created to help users practice and improve their Morse code skills. 

As a professional programmer and ham radio operator, PA5WPM, I took the challenge to create a Morse trainer that can run on any platform supporting a browser.
Now you can enjoy practicing Morse code on your favorite device, whether it's a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

Together with Nathan, PD5SAM, a blind ham radio operator, I took the challenge to make the Morse trainer accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments.
I learned a lot about accessibility and how to make web applications more inclusive. Thanks, Nathan!

During the development process of several months, I faced several challenges in generating sound and speech in Angular and how to synchronize them.

Of course, multiple version upgrades of Angular came along during those months.
Those version upgrades were absorbed when they became available with very little effort.
For me, it is the proof that being agile also means you have to be able to absorb changes in the ecosystem, and that this is possible with little effort.
If you fail on this point, you are agile in name only and should seek a job outside of IT. Being hacked because of known vulnerabilities is a deliberate choice! 

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.4.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
